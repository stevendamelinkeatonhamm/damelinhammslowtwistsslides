SlowTwists and Slides: 
Slow twists and slides are develped by Steven Damelin and Keaton Hamm as non rigid motions which behave locally rigidly in Eucldean-d-space.
They are globally rigid and are used and developed  for the first time in the monograph: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09748 (by Steven Damelin) which is
published by John Wiley & Sons.
